"""
Coin acceptor (monnayeur) : a pulse for each coin accepted (comparator of the front door,
12 V), turned by a relay into a contact closed on an input of a MCP23017 (common ground, as the
buttons ; the GPIO of the Raspberry are all taken by the biggest wirings of a target).

Each pulse is counted, never lost : the MCP keeps it itself (its interrupt on change : the state
captured at the edge, kept until read), read by a thread of its own every 20 ms, apart from the
loop of the game (stopped during a video or the drawing of a screen : a pulse of 0.1 s was
missed, read several times, or the pin banned as a button held down).

Modes : off (free), games (a coin gives credits ; a game costs a price by game or by type of
game, times the players by group : 4 players, a game for 2 = 2 credits), time (a coin gives
minutes, counted during the games). Its settings and the hash of its password are kept apart
from raspydarts.cfg, the file locked (chattr +i) ; the credits, the time left and the count of
the coins in a file of their own (kept when the cabinet is switched off).
